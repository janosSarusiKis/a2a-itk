"""ACTS document models, from the CDDL grammar in the spec's Appendix A.

Mirrors [A2A#1882](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/pull/1882) — see
``scenarios/acts/PROVENANCE.md`` for the pinned snapshot.

This module states what the CDDL permits, and nothing else — a description of
the format rather than of one snapshot of one corpus.

**What this validates, and what it deliberately does not.** The document
envelope, the suite and test envelopes, and the *shape* of every step are
checked here. Assertion trees are not: ``expect.body``, ``expect_parsed``,
``params``, ``wire_payload``, ``final_event`` and friends stay as plain data.

That is not laziness. Spec §5.2 makes ``expect.body`` a nested map mirroring
the response, so ``{status: {state: FOO}}`` is two levels of path followed by
an exact match, while ``{type: array, count_gte: 1}`` is two operators on one
value — and *nothing in the syntax distinguishes them*. Only the evaluator,
walking a real response, can tell which a given map is. Modelling assertions
as pydantic types here would either reject valid documents or invent a
distinction the format does not have.

So: this module rejects a document no runner could execute, and passes
everything else through intact.
