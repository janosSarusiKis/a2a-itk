"""The gRPC binding (A2A §10).

Built on the generated stubs over ``grpc.aio``, so that the status and
trailing metadata a typed client would discard stay visible to the assertions.

Two structural differences from the HTTP bindings:

- **There is no raw request.** ``dispatch_raw`` raises
  :class:`~test_suite.acts.dispatcher.base.UnsupportedByBinding`. Below
  protobuf there is nothing an ACTS ``raw`` block could describe, which is why
  §4.4 requires an all-raw test to name its transport.
- **There is no HTTP status.** ``WireResponse.status`` is derived from the
  gRPC status by the canonical transcoding, so that the 59 binding-agnostic
  corpus tests asserting ``status: 200`` mean "it succeeded" here too.

The agent card is still fetched over plain HTTP — the generated service has no
``GetAgentCard`` RPC, because the card is what tells a client that gRPC is on
offer in the first place.
