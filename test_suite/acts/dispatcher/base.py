"""What every dispatcher returns, and the contract all three implement.

A dispatcher turns an abstract ACTS step into one call on one binding and
reports what came back in a shape the runner can assert against, without the
runner knowing which binding ran. Everything binding-specific — method names,
paths, status codes — comes from :mod:`test_suite.acts.wire_map`.

## Why the transports are driven at a low level

A conformance suite asserts on what an application-facing client is built to
hide: the HTTP status, the response headers, the exact ``error.code``, whether
the body was valid JSON at all. Several tests also send payloads a
well-behaved client would refuse to construct. So the HTTP bindings are driven
with ``httpx`` directly and gRPC with the generated stubs over ``grpc.aio``,
rather than through a typed client that parses responses and raises on error.

The generated protobuf message types are reused as-is — they are a compiled
artifact of the proto, not behaviour, and regenerating them here would only
duplicate them.
