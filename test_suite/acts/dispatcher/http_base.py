"""Shared HTTP machinery.

JSON-RPC and REST differ in how a call is addressed and how an error is
spelled, and in nothing else: both are HTTP, both stream with Server-Sent
Events, both fetch the agent card from the same well-known path, and both send
raw steps verbatim. That common half lives here so the two adapters are left
stating only what actually distinguishes them.

The module-level helpers go one binding further. Fetching the agent card is
plain HTTP on *all three* bindings — see :func:`fetch_agent_card` — so the gRPC
adapter reaches in here too rather than keeping a second copy of the same GET.
