"""ACTS conformance pipeline: start the SUT, run the corpus, build a report.

The counterpart of :mod:`itk_runner`, and deliberately a separate module for
the same reason ACTS and traversal are separate suites: a traversal starts N
agents and walks a circuit between them, while a conformance run starts *one*
agent and interrogates it. Forcing both through one pipeline would mean a
plan step that is a no-op for half its callers.

Two front ends drive it, neither owning pipeline logic: ``itk_service_v2.py``
exposes it as ``POST /run-acts``, and ``run_acts.py`` runs it locally.

**Binding URLs come from the agent card, never from a convention.** An agent
may mount JSON-RPC at ``/jsonrpc/`` and REST at ``/rest/`` — the python one
does — so the card's ``supportedInterfaces`` is the only reliable source. The
card itself is always at the host root: it is what tells a client which
bindings exist, so it cannot sit behind one of them.

#: Default corpus, shipped in the image under `scenarios/acts/`.
DEFAULT_SUITE = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'scenarios' / 'acts' / 'suite.acts.yaml'

#: Tries at /health before giving up on the receiver and letting the tests
#: that need one skip.
_WEBHOOK_STARTUP_ATTEMPTS = 40

#: The identifier the SUT goes by, matching `itk_runner.SUT_ID`.
SUT_ID = 'current'

#: The protocol version this runner speaks, sent on every request including
#: the bootstrap card fetch. Matches `Runner`'s own default.
SPEC_VERSION = '1.0'

#: Bearer token the runner presents on every abstract operation, so an
#: operation the spec puts behind authentication can still be exercised. A2A
#: §13.3 requires `Get Extended Agent Card` to be authenticated, and
#: `CARD-EXT-001` fetches it expecting success — which only a runner holding a
#: credential can ask for.
#:
#: Raw steps never carry it: `dispatch_raw` drops the dispatcher's defaults, so
#: `SEC-EXTCARD-001` still sends nothing and `SEC-EXTCARD-002` still sends the
#: insufficient token. That is the whole reason those two mean anything, and
#: why the abstract and raw step kinds must not share a header set.
#:
#: Not a secret — a SUT's `itk/` fixture has to recognise it to answer 200
#: rather than 401. ACTS declares the *capability* a runner needs
#: (`runner_requirements: [auth_credentials]`) but never says what the
#: credential is, so this pairing is ours and is documented in `acts/`.
ACTS_AUTH_TOKEN = 'itk-valid-token'

#: Offered by `SEC-EXTCARD-002` as a token that authenticates but does not
#: authorize; a fixture should answer 403 rather than 401.
ACTS_INSUFFICIENT_TOKEN = 'itk-insufficient-token'

#: Set in the SUT's environment for the second pass. An agent that honours it
#: advertises none of the optional capabilities *and* refuses the operations
#: they gate.
#:
#: Four tests — `CORE-CAP-001`, `CORE-CAP-002`, `SEC-EXTCARD-003`,
#: `PUSH-CFG-004` — assert that an agent lacking a capability answers
#: `UnsupportedOperationError`. Their preconditions therefore require the card
#: *not* to advertise it, so against a fully capable SUT they skip, and the
#: "unsupported" branch of the protocol goes untested by anybody. It cannot be
#: fixed by relaxing the gate: an agent that advertises streaming is obliged to
#: stream, so the assertion would simply be wrong.
#:
#: One agent cannot both stream and not stream, hence a second pass against a
#: second, deliberately diminished instance. Every SDK already gates these
#: operations on its own card, so honouring this usually means nothing more
#: than publishing a smaller `capabilities` block.
REDUCED_CAPABILITIES_ENV = 'ITK_ACTS_REDUCED_CAPABILITIES'

#: The capabilities the reduced pass expects the SUT to drop.
REDUCIBLE_CAPABILITIES = ('streaming', 'pushNotifications', 'extendedAgentCard')

#: How `Runner._unmet_precondition` words a skip the reduced pass can clear:
#: the card advertises something the test needs absent.
_CAPABILITY_SKIP = re.compile(r'agent card capability (\w+)=True, needs False')

#: Set in the SUT's environment for the auth pass. An agent that honours it
#: declares a security scheme on its card *and* enforces it.
#:
#: `SEC-AUTH-001/002/003/004/006` assert that an agent requiring a credential
#: rejects a request that lacks one. A2A conditions that obligation on the
#: agent's own declared requirements, so against an agent declaring none the
#: tests are correctly not applicable — and every ITK fixture declares none by
#: default, because the traversal suite dials it with no credential at all.
#:
#: One agent cannot both require and not require a credential, which is the
#: same shape as the reduced pass and the reason this is a separate SUT rather
#: than a flag on the first one. Enforcing during the main pass instead would
#: cost fourteen raw steps that must be *served*: an absent `Authorization`
#: header means "reject me" in `SEC-AUTH-001` and "serve me" in
#: `JSONRPC-ENV-001`, and no server can tell those two requests apart.
AUTH_ENFORCED_ENV = 'ITK_ACTS_AUTH'

#: How `Runner._unmet_precondition` words a skip the auth pass can clear: the
#: card declares no security requirement and the test needs one. Deliberately
#: distinct from `_CAPABILITY_SKIP` — the two passes move the SUT along
#: different axes and neither may claim the other's skips.
_SECURITY_SKIP = re.compile(r'agent card authentication=False, needs True')

}

#: Capabilities (spec §12.1) this harness has by construction, as against
#: `webhook_endpoint`, which depends on a receiver a caller has to arrange and
#: so is granted per run in `_webhook_receiver`.
#:
#: The dispatchers put response headers on every `WireResponse` that has any:
#: both HTTP bindings on their normal path, and `fetch_agent_card` on all
#: three, the card being plain HTTP even under gRPC. A gRPC unary reply
#: carries none, but no test gated on this asks a gRPC RPC for one.
#:
#: `auth_credentials` is what §12.2 defines it as — supplying
#: `insufficientAuthToken` and `otherUserTaskId` — and `RUNNER_VARIABLES`
#: above supplies both to every front end. Not declaring it would skip
#: `SEC-AUTH-002`, `SEC-AUTH-003` and `SEC-EXTCARD-002` while claiming the

    Some preconditions are mutually exclusive with the deployment the rest of

    unauthenticated. Rather than leave those branches of the protocol untested
    by anybody, the run starts a second agent configured to meet them and
    splices its verdicts in.

    Each deviation is keyed on the *skip reason* rather than on a list of test
    ids: the corpus is authored upstream and copied here, so a hard-coded list
    would silently stop matching when a test is added or renamed, whereas a
    derived selector leaves an uncleared skip visible in the report.
